# Kiro Agent Hooks - Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

I've created a comprehensive agent hooks system for the Kiro ecosystem, specifically tailored for the interactive planview application. This implementation provides observability, monitoring, and extensibility through an event-driven architecture.

## Core System Components

### 1. Event Bus (`core/event-bus.ts`)
- Lightweight EventEmitter-based system
- Plugin execution with timeout protection
- Pattern-based event subscriptions
- Automatic metrics tracking and correlation IDs
- Error isolation and recovery

### 2. Type System (`core/types.ts`)
- Strongly typed event definitions
- Plugin interface specifications
- Configuration schemas
- Event naming conventions

### 3. Built-in Plugins

#### LoggerPlugin (`plugins/logger.ts`)
- Structured logging with configurable levels
- JSON and text output formats
- Automatic sensitive data sanitization
- Context and metrics inclusion

#### MetricsPlugin (`plugins/metrics.ts`)
- Event counting and duration tracking
- Rolling averages for performance metrics
- Error rate calculations
- Performance threshold monitoring

#### UINotifyPlugin (`plugins/ui-notify.ts`)
- User-facing notifications in Norwegian
- Auto-hide and manual dismissal options
- Action buttons for retry/details
- Type-based styling (success/warning/error)

### 4. Configuration System (`config/default-config.ts`)
- Declarative hook subscriptions
- Priority-based execution
- Pattern matching for domain-wide monitoring
- Conditional event handling

## Interactive Planview Integration

### React Hooks (`interactive-planview/src/hooks/useKiroHooks.ts`)
- Simplified event bus for React components
- Pre-built hooks for common planview operations
- Performance timing utilities
- Event listener management

### Demo Components
- **PlanviewLoader**: SVG file upload with event tracking
- **EventMonitor**: Real-time event visualization
- **App**: Complete demo showing all features

## Event Categories Implemented

### Planview Operations
- `kiro.planview.load.before/after/error`
- `kiro.planview.render.start/complete/error`
- `kiro.planview.performance.slow`

### User Interactions
- `kiro.ui.element.selected`
- `kiro.ui.layer.toggled`
- `kiro.ui.zoom.changed`
- `kiro.ui.measurement.completed`
- `kiro.ui.export.before/completed/error`

### System Events
- `kiro.agent.init/error`
- `kiro.perf.metrics`
- `kiro.perf.memory.threshold`

## Key Features Delivered

### 1. Observability by Design
- Every important operation emits events
- Automatic performance tracking
- Error correlation and context preservation
- Real-time metrics collection

### 2. Plugin Architecture
- Extensible plugin system
- Timeout protection and error isolation
- Parallel execution with priority ordering
- Hot-swappable configuration

### 3. User Experience
- Norwegian language notifications
- Visual event monitoring
- Automatic error recovery suggestions
- Performance warnings

### 4. Developer Experience
- Type-safe event definitions
- React hooks for easy integration
- Comprehensive examples and documentation
- Testing utilities included

## Performance Characteristics

- **Lightweight**: Minimal overhead event system
- **Scalable**: Pattern-based subscriptions for efficiency
- **Resilient**: Plugin failures don't break the system
- **Configurable**: Adjustable timeouts and filtering

## Testing and Quality

- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes
- ✅ Build process works correctly
- ✅ Unit tests pass
- ✅ Linting and formatting configured
- ✅ Real-world integration example

## Future Extensions

The system is designed to grow:

### Additional Domains
- IFC processing hooks (`kiro.ifc.*`)
- Room schedule hooks (`kiro.room.*`)
- Validation hooks (`kiro.validation.*`)
- Export hooks (`kiro.export.*`)

### Advanced Plugins
- Slack notifications
- Sentry error reporting
- Metrics dashboards
- Performance analytics

### Enhanced Features
- Event replay and debugging
- A/B testing support
- User behavior analytics
- Automated performance optimization

## Integration with Existing Systems

The hooks system is designed to integrate seamlessly with:
- The interactive planview React application
- The broader IFC processing pipeline
- External monitoring and alerting systems
- User notification systems

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Correlation IDs** for tracking related events
2. **Context preservation** for debugging
3. **Sensitive data sanitization** for security
4. **Timeout protection** for reliability
5. **Error isolation** for stability
6. **Performance monitoring** for optimization
7. **User-friendly messaging** for experience

This implementation provides a solid foundation for observability and extensibility in the Kiro ecosystem while maintaining simplicity and performance.
